# Training data

You can import this data into Edge Impulse via the [Edge Impulse CLI](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/cli-installation):

```
$ edge-impulse-uploader --clean
$ edge-impulse-uploader --category training training/*.wav
$ edge-impulse-uploader --category testing testing/*.wav
```

Note that this data was gathered from one bathroom and probably generalizes very poorly.
